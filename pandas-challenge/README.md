Data from 15 schools were collected with a total student count of 39,170. The average math score per student was 78.99 and the average reading score was 81.88. While approximately 75% of students passed math and 86% passed reading, only 65% of students passed both. There were two types of schools observed: charter and district. Charter schools had less students and slightly lower budgets per capita than district schools. 

From this data the conclusion can be drawn that district schools had lower percentage of overall passing rates than the charter schools. There also did not seem to be a correlation between the per capita spending and budget and the passing rates.
